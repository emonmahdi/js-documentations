ES6+ introduced numerous features that have transformed JavaScript programming, making code more readable, maintainable, and robust:

let/const: Block-scoped variables with clearer semantics
Arrow functions: Concise syntax and lexical this binding
Template literals: String interpolation and multi-line strings
Destructuring: Extract values from objects and arrays easily
Spread/rest operators: Work with collections more efficiently
Default parameters: Simpler function definitions
Classes: Cleaner syntax for object-oriented programming
Promises and async/await: Better asynchronous code management
ES Modules: Standardized code organization
Enhanced object literals: More concise object syntax
Optional chaining & nullish coalescing: Safer property access and defaults
