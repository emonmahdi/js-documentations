To get the parent node of a specified node in the DOM tree, you use the parentNode property:

let parent = node.parentNode;

The parentNode is read-only.

The Document and DocumentFragment nodes do not have a parent. Therefore, the parentNode will always be null.

If you create a new node but havenâ€™t attached it to the DOM tree, the parentNode of that node will also be null.

Summary
The node.parentNode returns the read-only parent node of a specified node or null if it does not exist.
The document and DocumentFragment do not have a parent node.
