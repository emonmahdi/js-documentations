// In programming languages, including JavaScript, syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs must be written in order to be valid and understandable by the language's compiler or interpreter. It defines the proper structure and format that code must adhere to for it to be considered correct. A violation of syntax rules typically results in syntax errors, which prevent the code from being executed.

// Here are some key points about syntax in JavaScript:

// 1. **Syntax Rules:**
//    - JavaScript has a set of rules that dictate how statements, expressions, and other language elements should be written.
//    - For example, statements must end with a semicolon (`;`), and blocks of code are defined using curly braces `{}`.

// 2. **Examples of Syntax:**
//    - Variable Declaration:

var x;

//    - Function Declaration:

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// 3. **Case Sensitivity:**
//    - JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that `variableName` and `variablename` would be treated as two different variables.

// 4. **Whitespace:**
//    - JavaScript is relatively lenient when it comes to whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks), as long as it doesn't affect the meaning of the code.

// 5. **Comments:**
//    - Comments are used to add explanatory notes within the code. They don't affect the program's execution and are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.

// This is a single-line comment

/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 * spanning multiple lines
 */

// 6. **Syntax Errors:**
//    - If there's a mistake in the code that violates JavaScript syntax rules, a syntax error will occur. The error message will provide information about the issue and its location in the code.

// Example of a syntax error:

var x = 10;
console.log(x);

// In this case, a semicolon is missing at the end of the first line, resulting in a syntax error.

// Understanding and following JavaScript syntax is crucial for writing code that can be correctly interpreted and executed by browsers or other JavaScript environments. Code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) often help developers catch syntax errors by highlighting them in real-time.
